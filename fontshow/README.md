## fontshow - a utility to a representation of various bitmap or raster fonts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this utility is to show how a bitmap font table containing raw bitmap data such as a C language
array of unsigned char will generate pixels.

See also the repository https://github.com/viler-int10h/vga-text-mode-fonts which contains a large number of raster
or bitmap fonts pulled from the BIOS of a number of computing devices.
