## A Lightweight Indexed File for Storing Persistent Data and Objects

This library was one I developed as an experiment in creating a single library
that I would use for several different operational data files in a point of sale
application.

A description of the library is in a PDF print of the original CodeProject article
I wrote describing the library and providing the source code for the library.

Since CodeProject, https://www.codeproject.com/, appears to now, Fall of 2024, be archived
and no longer the community platform it
once was I pulled a copy of the article and the source code using Google search to
help me find the article. Fortunately the links that Google had crawled still worked so
I was able to find the page.

I've put a copy here so that I can work with it some more.
