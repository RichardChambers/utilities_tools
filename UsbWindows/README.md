This folder contains some experiments with USB on the Windows platform.

I'm looking into being able to connect to a thermal receipt printer over a USB connection
rather than a Serial Port connection (physical COM port or a virtual COM port).

The purpose of this material is to develop some knowledge and body of code for being
able to interact with a USB device such as a thermal receipt printer or a scale or
other USB connected serial device that does not create a Virtual Serial Port when
the USB cable is connected to a Windows PC.
